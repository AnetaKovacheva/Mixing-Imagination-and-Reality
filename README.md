# Mixing Imagination and Reality # 
was drafted as an exam project for Deep Learning training course at SoftUni. Used images are stored in folders. The model in Chapter 4 was trained with slightly less than 2000 images from Caltech256 dataset. To that end, 19 folders with Caltech images were selected (and stored in 10_ObjectCategories).

The project is organised into 3 ipynb files:
- DL_Final_Project_Style_Transfer_AK_01.ipynb - Style Transfer with VGG implementation
- DL_Final_Project_Style_Transfer_AK_02.ipynb - Style Transfer with ResNet50 implementation
- DL_Final_Project_Style_Transfer_AK_03.ipynb - an attempt to train a new model and to use it for Style Transfer
